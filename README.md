## Requirements

### Host System

- **Vagrant** + **QEMU** (for local builds: `brew install vagrant qemu && vagrant plugin install vagrant-qemu`)
- **Python 3** with `edl` tool (for flashing via EDL mode)

## Configuration

### variables.env

Copy `variables.env.example` to `variables.env` and edit to customize your build:

```bash
cp variables.env.example variables.env
```

```bash
HOST_NAME="uz801a"
USERNAME="user"
PASSWORD="changeme"          # Required — build fails if not set
WIFI_SSID="MyNetwork"        # Optional — WiFi SSID to connect to
WIFI_PASS="MyPassword"       # Optional — WiFi password
WIFI_IP=""                   # Optional static WiFi IPv4 CIDR; empty = DHCP
WIFI_GW=""                   # Optional gateway for WIFI_IP
WIFI_DNS=""                  # Optional DNS for WIFI_IP
DTB_FILE="msm8916-yiming-uz801v3.dtb"   # DTB to use in extlinux.conf
USB0_IP="192.168.42.1/24"   # Static IP for USB gadget (with DHCP server)
                             # Set to "dhcp" when plugged into a router (OpenWrt, etc.)

# Optional mirror overrides
RELEASE="v3.21"
PMOS_RELEASE="v25.06"
# MIRROR="http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine"
# PMOS_MIRROR="http://mirror.postmarketos.org/postmarketos"

# Extra packages to install (essentials are hardcoded in the script)
PACKAGES="
chrony
zoraxy
wireguard-tools
wireguard-tools-wg-quick
neofetch
htop
"

# Extra services to auto-start (essentials are hardcoded in the script)
SERVICES_AUTOSTART="
chronyd
zoraxy
"
```

`variables.env` is git-ignored so your credentials are never committed.

### WiFi Configuration

Set `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` in `variables.env`. The build will substitute them into the NetworkManager connection automatically.

By default WiFi uses DHCP. To bake in a static WiFi address for any profile/stack, set:

```bash
WIFI_IP="192.168.1.50/24"
WIFI_GW="192.168.1.1"
WIFI_DNS="1.1.1.1;8.8.8.8;"
```

### DTB Selection

Set `DTB_FILE` in `variables.env` to select which compiled DTB the bootloader uses. See `dtbs/readme.md` for available options.

### USB0 IP Mode

`USB0_IP` controls how the USB gadget interface is configured:

- **Static IP** (default): `USB0_IP="192.168.42.1/24"` — acts as a DHCP server for the connected host.
- **DHCP client**: `USB0_IP="dhcp"` — useful when the device is plugged into a router (e.g. OpenWrt) that assigns IPs.

### USB Gadget Configuration

USB gadget uses a simple configuration file `/etc/usb-gadget.conf`:

```bash
# MSM8916 USB Gadget Configuration

USE_NCM=1           # 1 = NCM (Linux/Mac), 0 = RNDIS (Windows)
ENABLE_OTG=0        # 1 = OTG Host mode, 0 = Gadget mode
```

**Management commands:**
```bash
# Enable NCM mode (Linux/Mac compatible)
usb-gadget enable_ncm

# Enable RNDIS mode (Windows compatible)
usb-gadget disable_ncm

# Enable OTG Host mode (for USB peripherals)
usb-gadget enable_otg

# Disable OTG (back to gadget mode)
usb-gadget disable_otg

# View current config
usb-gadget status

# Apply changes
rc-service usb-gadget restart
```

## Custom Device Trees

The build system can compile DTS (Device Tree Source) files from the upstream Linux kernel and from the local `dts/` directory.

### Upstream DTS (auto-compiled)

`make build` automatically fetches the kernel DTS tree (cached in `.kernel-dts/`) and compiles these upstream files:

- `msm8916-yiming-uz801v3.dts`
- `msm8916-thwc-uf896.dts`
- `msm8916-thwc-ufi001c.dts`

### Custom DTS

Add your own `.dts` files to the `dts/` directory. They are compiled with the same flags and include paths as the upstream files, so you can reference kernel DTSI files:

```dts
// dts/msm8916-mydevice.dts
/dts-v1/;
#include "msm8916-ufi.dtsi"
// ... your customizations
```

Compile only DTS (without full build):

```bash
make dts
```

Output goes to `files/dtbs/`. See `dtbs/readme.md` for the list of precompiled fallback DTBs.

## Usage

### 1. Build everything

**Preferred — profile builds:**

Pick an appliance profile. Run these commands **inside the builder VM** (via `make builder`) or in CI; they build rootfs, boot image, `firmware.zip`, and GPT table:

```bash
make octoprint   # OctoPrint: native 3D printer interface, no Docker
make docker      # Docker-enabled base image
make zoraxy      # Zoraxy: native reverse proxy, no Docker
```

Profile images are **minimal**: only the packages and services for the chosen appliance are installed. Installer scripts for other stacks are **not** copied to the device — the selected stack is wired in at build time.

USB gadget tooling (`usb-gadget`, `/etc/usb-gadget.conf`) is installed and auto-started in the **default**, **docker**, and **zoraxy** profiles. The **octoprint** profile is the exception: it sets `USB_GADGET_INSTALL="no"` because the USB port is used as host for the printer — gadget tooling is omitted and USB OTG host mode is forced at boot instead (`USB_GADGET_OTG="yes"`).

> **Vagrant artifact flow:** Profile targets (`make octoprint`, `make docker`, `make zoraxy`) run `make build-all PROFILE=...` inside the VM or CI and do **not** call `make fetch`. After the build finishes, exit the VM and run `make fetch` on the host to copy artifacts. The host targets `make build-vm` / `make build-all-vm` handle the full cycle (up → build → fetch) automatically but are generic — they do not set a profile.

See **[docs/profiles.md](docs/profiles.md)** for a full breakdown of what each profile installs, which services it enables, and how USB mode is set.

---

**Option A — interactive shell inside the VM:**

```bash
# Open a shell in the builder VM (first time provisions automatically)
make builder

# Inside the VM: build rootfs + boot image
make build

# Or build everything including firmware.zip and GPT table
make build-all

# Exit the VM
exit

# Back on the host — copy artifacts from the VM to host files/
make fetch
```

> **Note:** vagrant-qemu uses SLIRP user networking; NFS and shared folders are not
> available. `make fetch` is the only way to copy artifacts to the host.

**Option B — one-shot from the host (recommended, no interactive shell needed):**

```bash
make build-vm       # build inside VM and fetch artifacts automatically
make build-all-vm   # same but includes firmware.zip and GPT table
```

`make fetch` is always safe to re-run — it overwrites artifacts with the latest build.

**Build output** in `files/`:
- `rootfs.bin` - Alpine rootfs sparse image
- `rootfs.tgz` - Alpine rootfs tarball
- `boot.bin` - Kernel + initramfs boot image
- `gpt_both0.bin` - GPT partition table for 4GB eMMC (with `build-all`)
- `firmware.zip` - Complete firmware package (with `build-all`)

### 2. Flash to device via EDL

#### Enter EDL Mode

1. Power off the device completely
2. Hold **Volume Up** button
3. Connect USB cable while holding button
4. Device enters EDL mode (no screen indication)

#### Flash with EDL

```bash
./flash.sh
```

### 3. First Boot

After flashing and reboot:
1. Device boots Alpine Linux (~30-45 seconds)
2. Rootfs automatically expands to fill eMMC
3. WiFi connects to configured network
4. USB gadget activates (NCM/RNDIS interface)
5. USB interface gets IP 192.168.42.1/24 with DHCP server
6. SSH server starts on port 22

**Access via SSH:**
```bash
# Via WiFi (check router for IP)
ssh user@192.168.77.XXX

# Via USB
ssh user@192.168.42.1

# Default credentials
Username: user
Password: (configured in variables.env)
```

## Optional Stacks

The `stacks/` directory contains install scripts and Docker Compose files for optional services.

- **Profile builds** (`make octoprint`, `make docker`, `make zoraxy`): the selected stack is preinstalled at build time. No installer scripts are left on the device.
- **Base builds** (`make build`): install scripts are not copied automatically — copy and run them from the repo's `stacks/` directory as a manual/custom workflow, or customise `variables.env`.

### OctoPrint (3D printer interface)

Native OctoPrint core for a Creality Ender-3 V3 SE (or similar USB-serial printer). No Docker, no webcam — designed for the ~384 MB RAM constraint. Pre-installed by `make octoprint`. See **[docs/octoprint.md](docs/octoprint.md)** for build, flash, USB printer connectivity, serial drivers, and troubleshooting.

- Web UI: `http://<device-ip>:5000`
- Service: `rc-service octoprint start|stop|restart|status`
- Logs: `/var/log/octoprint/octoprint.log`
- Data: `/var/lib/octoprint`
- DTB: use `msm8916-yiming-uz801v3-octoprint.dtb` to reclaim ~91 MB from LTE + video decode reserves

### Zoraxy (Reverse Proxy)

Reverse proxy with HTTPS termination and web admin panel. Pre-installed as a native service by `make zoraxy`. A Docker Compose file is also available under `stacks/` for `docker` profile builds.

- Admin panel: `http://<device-ip>:8000`
- Config: `/opt/zoraxy/config/`
- Service: `rc-service zoraxy start|stop|restart`

### Homer (Dashboard)

Lightweight static homepage served by Zoraxy. Copy `stacks/install-homer.sh` to the device and run it after the `zoraxy` profile is up.

- Installs to `/opt/homer/html/`
- Config: `/opt/homer/html/assets/config.yml`

### Portainer (Docker UI)

```bash
docker compose -f stacks/portainer.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

- Web UI: `http://<device-ip>:9000`

### Watchtower (Auto-update containers)

```bash
docker compose -f stacks/watchtower.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

- Checks for container updates daily at 04:00
- Automatically pulls and restarts updated containers

## Profile Validation

After flashing and first boot, confirm the selected profile is active:

```bash
# USB gadget tooling (default, docker, zoraxy profiles — not octoprint)
usb-gadget status

# OctoPrint profile
rc-service octoprint status        # should show 'started'
ls /var/lib/octoprint/             # data directory exists

# Docker profile
rc-service docker status           # should show 'started'
docker info                        # daemon responds

# Zoraxy profile
rc-service zoraxy status           # should show 'started'
curl -s http://localhost:8000 | head -5   # admin panel responds

# No stray installer scripts from unused stacks
ls ~/install-*.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "clean — no unused installer scripts"
```

For an automated check of the OctoPrint profile, run inside the builder VM:

```bash
make verify-octoprint
```
